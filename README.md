# conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
This GitHub action executes conditional search and replace operations on multiple files. Strings in files are replaced, if they match a given regular expressions.

Originally, this action has been created to update strings - like Docker image tag and Git branches - in Helm charts and Kustomize templates inside of Git repositories used for GitOps projects.
When using the [environment-per-folder strategy](https://dreitier.com/knowledge-base/continuous-delivery-and-deployment/using-environment-per-folder-directory-structure-for-gitops-projects-with-argo-cd-and-helm), updating the designated file for one or multiple environments can be cumbersome.
If you want to use this action indeed for updating GitOps repositories, please look at [this article](https://dreitier.com/knowledge-base/continuous-delivery-and-deployment/promoting-new-docker-images-to-helm-charts-in-github-repositories-with-github-actions) on how to execute it with `repository_dispatch`.

## Usage

```yaml
uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
env:
with:
  mappings: "docker_image_tag==main.* {THEN_UPDATE_FILES} **dev/values.yaml=docker_image_tag_regex"
  docker_image_tag: "${{ github.sha }}"
  docker_image_tag_regex: "imageTag: \\\"(?<docker_image_tag>.*)\\\""
```

### Optional arguments
| Argument                          | Default | Description                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------| --- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `directory`                       | `$CWD` | Directory, in which to operate. By default, the current working directory is used.                                                                                 |

| `if_no_match_fail`                | `0` | If the action has not modified any file and `if_no_match_fail` is `1`, it will fail with exit code `3`                                                  |
| `if_well_known_vars_missing_fail` | `0` | If `1`, it fails with exit code `2` if none of docker_image_tag, git_branch or git_tag is provided                                                      |

| `commit`                          | `0` | If there has been any modified files (see below, `outputs.total_modified_files`), it will commit the changes to the Git repository                      |
| `commit_template`                 | `<none>` | Template to use for the commit message. You can use the [Blade template engine](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/blade) to dynamically specify the message. |

### Well-known variables and regular expressions
Due the original requirement of this action, you can use the following built-in variables:

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `__always__` and `__true__` | Both variables are automatically set to `1` |
| `docker_image_tag` | Docker image tag created by upstream repository |
| `docker_image_tag_regex` | Regular expression to modify occurences of Docker image tags in globbed files |
| `git_tag` | Git tag created by upstream repository |
| `git_tag_regex` | Regular expression to modify occurences of Git tags in globbed files |
| `git_branch` | Git branch modified in upstream repository |
| `git_branch_regex` | Regular expression to modify occurences of Git branch in globbed files |

There is __no__ need to use `docker_image_tag_regex`, `git_tag_regex` and `git_branch_regex`, those regular expressions are automatically registered. You can register additional regular expressions as you like.

#### Registering additional regular expressions
Additional regular expressions must be provided in the following format:

```yaml
uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
with:
  # ...
  register_custom_regexes: check_for_customer_regex
env:
  CHECK_FOR_CUSTOMER_REGEX: "/customer: (<customer_number>\d+)/"
```

To register mulitple regular expressions, use a comma (`,`) for separation:

```yaml
uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
with:
  # ...
  register_custom_regexes: check_for_customer_regex, project_id_regex
env:
  CHECK_FOR_CUSTOMER_REGEX: "/customer: (?<customer_number>\d+)/"
  PROJECT_ID_REGEX: "/project: (?<project_id>\d+)/"
```


#### Registering additional variables
To provide additional variables aside from `docker_image_tag`, `git_tag` and `git_branch` you have to register those variables.
For referencing the `customer_number` variable of the previous section, you have to register it:

```yaml
uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
with:
  # ...
  register_custom_variables: customer_number
env:
  CUSTOMER_NUMBER: "555"
```

To register multiple variables, use a comma (`,`) for separation:

```yaml
uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
with:
  # ...
  register_custom_variables: customer_number, project_id
env:
  CUSTOMER_NUMBER: "555"
  PROJECT_ID: "5550555
```

#### Git commit message templates
When using `commit_template`, you can either put in some static string or you can use the [Blade template engine](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/blade) to dynamically specify the message.
Each of the well-known and custom variables is passed as variable to the template. If you have a custom variable `customer_number`, you can access the value with `{{ $customer_number }}`.

Use a static string:
```yaml
uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
with:
  # ...
  commit_template: 'A new version has been born.'
```

Reference a well-known variable:
```yaml
uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
with:
  # ...
  docker_image_tag: '1.0.0'
  commit_template: 'chore: Update to Docker image tag {{ $docker_image_tag }}'
```

Reference a custom variable:
```yaml
uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
with:
  # ...
  register_custom_variables: customer_number
  docker_image_tag: '1.0.0'
  commit_template: 'chore: Update to Docker image tag {{ $docker_image_tag } for customer {{ $customer_number))'
env:
    CUSTOMER_NUMBER: "555" # or set it to an empty string
```

Expressions:
```yaml
uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
with:
  # ...
  register_custom_variables: customer_number
  docker_image_tag: '1.0.0'
  commit_template: 'chore: Update to Docker image tag {{ $docker_image_tag }}@if(!empty($customer_number)) for customer {{ $customer_number }}@endif'
env:
    CUSTOMER_NUMBER: "" # or a non-empty string
```

#### Mappings
Mappings specify, if one or multiple regular expressions match, how other regular expressions are applied. It's basically

```yaml
uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
with:
  mappings: '<if_first_regex_match> OR <if_second_regex_match> {THEN_UPDATE_FILES} <change_first_file_group>=<apply_regex_1> {AND} <change_second_file_group>=<apply_regex_1>&<apply_regex_2>'
```

In each regular expression to apply, you have access to all well-known and custom variables through named capturing groups:

```yaml
uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
  register_custom_variables: customer_number
  register_custom_regexes: my_regex
  docker_image_tag: '1.0.0'
  docker_image_tag_regex: 'imageTag: \"(?<docker_image_tag).*)\"'
  mappings: 'docker_image_tag==.* {THEN_UPDATE_FILES} **.yaml=docker_image_tag_regex&my_regex'
env:
  CUSTOMER_NUMBER: "555"
  MY_REGEX: '.*customer: \"(?<customer_number>.*)\".*'
```

### Outputs

| Output | Default | Description                                        |
| --- | --- |----------------------------------------------------|
| `total_modified_files` | `0` | Number of modified (target) files.                 |
| `$your_variable` | `` | Any of your provded well-known or custom variables |

You can reference the output variables in your GitHub Action workflow like this:

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job_with_dedicated_commit_and_push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Update repository  
        id: search_and_replace_op
        uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
        with:
          # ...

      # instead of using this action's commit hook, we use the more flexible EndBug/add-and-commit if any file has been modified
      - name: Commit and push
        if: ${{ steps.search_and_replace.outputs.total_modified_files >= 1 }}
        uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v7
        with:
          author_name: build@internalcom
          author_email: build@internal
          message: "There have been {{ steps.search_and_replace.outputs.total_modified_files }} modified files"
```

To access e.g. the `customer_number` from before

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job_with_dedicated_commit_and_push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Update repository
        id: search_and_replace_op
        uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
        with:
          register_custom_variables: customer_number
          docker_image_tag: '1.0.0'
          # ...
        env:
            CUSTOMER_NUMBER: "555"

      - name: Commit and push
        if: ${{ steps.search_and_replace.outputs.total_modified_files >= 1 }}
        uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v7
        with:
          author_name: build@internal
          author_email: build@internal
          message: "Customer number {{ steps.search_and_replace.outputs.customer_number }} has {{ steps.search_and_replace.outputs.total_modified_files }} modified files for tag {{ steps.search_and_replace.outputs.docker_image_tag }}"
```

## Examples
### Updating strings in multiple files

In a folder structure like this
```
├── asia
│   ├── dev
│   │   ├── values.yaml
│   └── prod
│       ├── values.yaml
├── eu
│   ├── dev
│   │   └── values.yaml
│   └── prod
```

the files `eu/dev/values.yaml` and `asia/dev/values.yaml` have be modified. The original content of both `values.yaml` files looks like this:

```yaml
custom_parameter: custom_value
imageTag: v0.1.0
other_parameter: other_custom_value
```

We want to update the `imageTag` value in both `values.yaml` files from `v0.1.0` to `v0.2.0`:

```yaml
uses: dreitier/conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action
env:
with:
  mappings: "docker_image_tag==v.* {THEN_UPDATE_FILES} **dev/values.yaml=docker_image_tag_regex"
  docker_image_tag: "v0.2.0"
  docker_image_tag_regex: "imageTag: \\\"(?<docker_image_tag>.*)\\\""
```

After running `conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action`, both files will look like this:
```yaml
custom_parameter: custom_value
imageTag: v0.2.0
other_parameter: other_custom_value
```

#### Transformed into pseudo code
Sometimes it's easier to read pseudo code instead of skimming through YAML files. The above YAML's definition can be read as
```
if $docker_image_tag =~ /v.*/ then
    $files = glob_files_with_matcher("**dev/values.yaml")
    
    foreach $files as $file
        foreach $line in $file
            if $line =~ /imageTag: \"(?<docker_image_tag>.*)\"/ then
                $line = "imageTag: \"$docker_image_tag\""
                write_line_to_file($file, $line)
            fi
        endforeach
    endforeach
endif
```

### Do not check a regex for a given pattern
If you do not have to check one or multiple known variable for a regex, you can simply use the well-known variables `__always__` or `__true__`:

```yaml
with:
  mappings: "__always__ {THEN_UPDATE_FILES} **dev/values.yaml=docker_image_tag_regex"
  docker_image_tag: "v0.2.0"
  docker_image_tag_regex: "imageTag: \\\"(?<docker_image_tag>.*)\\\""
```

By using `__always__` or `__true__` the replacement will be applied, regardless of one of the variable's value.

### Updating multiple values at the same time
If you need to apply multiple regexes at the same time, you can chain those regexes with:

```yaml
with:
  mappings: "docker_image_tag==v.* {THEN_UPDATE_FILES} **dev/values.yaml=docker_image_tag_regex&git_branch_regex"
  git_branch: "feature/165-integrate-kerberos-auth"
  git_branch_regex: "branch: \\\"(?<git_branch>.*)\\\""
  docker_image_tag: "v0.2.0"
  docker_image_tag_regex: "imageTag: \\\"(?<docker_image_tag>.*)\\\""
```

A `values.yaml` of this:
```yaml
custom_parameter: custom_value
imageTag: v0.2.0
branch: old-branch
```

will be transformed into this:
```yaml
custom_parameter: custom_value
imageTag: v0.2.0
branch: feature/165-integrate-kerberos-auth
```

#### Transformed into pseudo code
```
if $docker_image_tag =~ /v.*/ then
    $files = glob_files_with_matcher("**dev/values.yaml")
    
    foreach $files as $file
        foreach $line in $file
            if $line =~ /imageTag: \"(?<docker_image_tag>.*)\"/ then
                $line = "imageTag: \"$docker_image_tag\""
                write_line_to_file($file, $line)
            fi
            if $line =~ /branch: \"(?<git_branch>.*)\"/ then
                $line = "git_branch: \"$git_branch\""
                write_line_to_file($file, $line)
            fi
        endforeach
    endforeach
endif
```

### Check, if at least one variable matches
Sometimes you want to update files if at least one of multiple conditions is valid. `mappings` support a simple `{OR}` operator.

```yaml
with:
  mappings: "docker_image_tag==v.* {OR} git_branch==feature\/.* {THEN_UPDATE_FILES} **dev/values.yaml=docker_image_tag_regex&git_branch_regex"
  git_branch: "feature/165-integrate-kerberos-auth"
  git_branch_regex: "branch: \\\"(?<git_branch>.*)\\\""
  docker_image_tag: "latest"
  docker_image_tag_regex: "imageTag: \\\"(?<docker_image_tag>.*)\\\""
```

#### Transformed into pseudo code
```
if $docker_image_tag =~ /v.*/ or $git_branch =~ /feature\/.*/ then
    $files = glob_files_with_matcher("**dev/values.yaml")
    
    foreach $files as $file
        foreach $line in $file
            if $line =~ /imageTag: \"(?<docker_image_tag>.*)\"/ then
                $line = "imageTag: \"$docker_image_tag\""
                write_line_to_file($file, $line)
            fi
            if $line =~ /branch: \"(?<git_branch>.*)\"/ then
                $line = "git_branch: \"$git_branch\""
                write_line_to_file($file, $line)
            fi
        endforeach
    endforeach
endif
```

### Multiple mappings
This action's DSL for defining mappings does __not__ feature a `{AND}` condition in the left-hand part of `{THEN_UPDATE_FILES}`. Instead, you can chain multiple mappings together. Use De Morgan's law for complex conditions ;-)
Each of those mappings will be separately evaluated:

```yaml
with:
  mappings: "docker_image_tag==v.* {THEN_UPDATE_FILES} **dev/values.yaml=docker_image_tag_regex {NEXT_MAPPING} git_branch==feature\/.* {THEN_UPDATE_FILES} **dev/values.yaml=git_branch_regex"
  git_branch: "feature/165-integrate-kerberos-auth"
  git_branch_regex: "branch: \\\"(?<git_branch>.*)\\\""
  docker_image_tag: "v2.0.0"
  docker_image_tag_regex: "imageTag: \\\"(?<docker_image_tag>.*)\\\""
```

#### Transformed into pseudo code
```
if $docker_image_tag =~ /v.*/ then
    $files = glob_files_with_matcher("**dev/values.yaml")
    
    foreach $files as $file
        foreach $line in $file
            if $line =~ /imageTag: \"(?<docker_image_tag>.*)\"/ then
                $line = "imageTag: \"$docker_image_tag\""
                write_line_to_file($file, $line)
            fi
        endforeach
    endforeach
endif

if $git_branch =~ /feature\/.*/ then
    $files = glob_files_with_matcher("**dev/values.yaml")
    
    foreach $files as $file
        foreach $line in $file
            if $line =~ /branch: \"(?<git_branch>.*)\"/ then
                $line = "git_branch: \"$git_branch\""
                write_line_to_file($file, $line)
            fi
        endforeach
    endforeach
endif
```

## FAQ
### Why not using something more GitOps-esk like Argo CD Image Updater?
Using Argo CD Image Updater is totally fine but might have some drawbacks:
- By default, Argo CD Image Updater checks the Docker registries every 2 minutes. There might be a good chance of hitting API request limits, e.g. with Docker Hub.
- Setting up Argo CD Image Updater might be difficult, depending upon the environment.
- Argo CD Image Updater does not support complex search-and-replace operations.

When using `conditional-regex-search-and-replace-action`, you can either configure Webhooks in your GitOps repository to notify Argo CD or let Argo CD pull the latest version.

### Why are you not using Bash/$your_favorite_language_here for this action?
Before introducing this action, I've developed a Bash script for updating various GitOps repositories. Different projects had different requirements: The Bash script was no longer maintainable.
Using Laravel Zero and Pest for developing testable GitHub Actions looks fine to me.

### But I can do everything with awk & sed.
Just keep using `awk` & `sed`, it's fine!

### Why looks the DSL like it does?
Due to the nature of complexity and how parameters are passed from the GitHub workflow to single actions, it was the first approach I came up with.
I also thought about using Blade templates for doing the mapping stuff.

## DSL spec

```
next_mapping            = "{NEXT_MAPPING}"
if_match_then_execute   = "{THEN_UPDATE_FILES}"
glob                    = $valid_glob
regex                   = $valid_quoted_regex
variable_reference      = (lower_case_chars | digits | '_')+
regex_reference         = (lower_case_chars | digits | '_')+

matches                 = "=="
matcher                 = variable_reference (matches regex)?
or_matcher              = "{OR}"
matchers                = matcher (or_matcher matcher)+

regex_references        = regex_reference ('&' regex_reference)+
assign_to               = '='
replacer                = glob assign_to regex_references
replacers               = replacer (and_replacer replacer)+
and_replacer            = "{AND}"

mapping                 = matchers if_match_then_execute replacers
multiple_mappings       = mapping (next_mapping mapping)+
```
